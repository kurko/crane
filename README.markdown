Rubylift is an app that will syncronize files by FTP, getting the bore out of your
path :-)

How boring is it to send files through FTP? What about the moment you have to send
just a couple of files, not the whole directories? This is very annoying,
specially for freelancers.

Rubylift will take care of the files for you. All you have to do is type:

$ ./uplift push

If you want to send only the files modified today, try:

$ ./uplift push today

Uplift will upload only the files you want.


HOW TO START USING UPLIFT?

First, you have to have Ruby installed. It depends on your OS.

Then, get a copy of Uplift and put it into your project's folder. Now you need to configure your
project, however Uplift provides an easy way to do that. Type:

$ ./uplift init

Answer those questions and whenever you need to know if everything is alright, type:

$ ./uplift test

Uplift won't look up for git files (.git directory and .gitignore), nor its own files. So you
can put it into your projects folder.
